### Implementation Plan

#### 1. ✓ Initial Setup and Preparation
1.1. ✓ **Clone the GitHub Repository**
  - ✓ Ensure the local environment is properly set up.
  - ✓ Manage the package with Poetry.

1.2. ✓ **Project Structure and Core Setup**
  - [1.2.1] ✓ Install a command with the same name as the project using docopt for argument parsing and usage.
  - [1.2.2] ✓ Ensure the core functionality can be called from other modules.

#### 2. ✓ Version Management
2.1. ✓ **Implement Version Handling**
  - [2.1.1] ✓ Ensure that the program picks up the version from `pyproject.toml` regardless of the execution context.
  - [2.1.2] ✓ Set the initial version to 0.1.

#### 3. ✓ Documentation
3.1. ✓ **High-Level Design Document**
  - [3.1.1] ✓ Write a clear but concise high-level design document named "High-Level-Design.md".

3.2. ✓ **Detailed Level Design Document**
  - [3.2.1] ✓ Write a comprehensive detailed level design document named "Detailed-Design.md".

3.3. ✓ **README.md**
  - [3.3.1] ✓ Write a complete README.md including:
    - ✓ Modest usage instructions for both command-line and API usage.
    - ✓ Links to the manual page, API documentation, and design documents.

3.4. ✓ **Manual Page**
  - [3.4.1] ✓ Write a comprehensive UNIX-style manual page for the command in markdown.

3.5. ✓ **API Documentation**
  - [3.5.1] ✓ Write comprehensive API documentation with numerous testable examples.
  - [3.5.2] ✓ Create an "example" directory for a fake test hierarchy if necessary.

#### 4. ✓ Code Review and Refactoring
4.1. ✓ **Revise Layout and Code**
  - [4.1.1] ✓ Ensure the layout and all code are pythonic and follow PEP8 guidelines.

4.2. ✓ **Rename Package and Command**
  - [4.2.1] ✓ Rename the package and command from `hierarchy` to `pdirtree`.

#### 5. Testing
5.1. **Comprehensive Tests**
  - [5.1.1] ✓ Ensure all API code is thoroughly tested, covering normal use cases, corner cases, and potential errors.
    - [5.1.1.1] ✓ Use an 'example' hierarchy for tests.
    - [5.1.1.2] ✓ Implement mock tests for file system errors.
    - [5.1.1.3] Verify that all of these tests pass

5.2. **Mock Testing**
  - [5.2.1] ✓ Implement mock testing for external features that the API normally accesses.

5.3. **File System Testing**
  - [5.3.1] ✓ Build a test hierarchy for real file system usage tests if appropriate.

5.4. **Real World Tests**
  - [5.4.1] SKIP Write typical real-world tests that are conditional and not enabled by default.

#### 6. Building and Packaging
6.1. **Build the Project**
  - [6.1.1] Use `poetry build` to create source distribution and wheel.

6.2. **Register and Upload to PyPI**
  - [6.2.1] Register an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and use `poetry publish` to upload the package.

#### 7. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
7.1. **Setup CI/CD Pipelines**
  - [7.1.1] Implement automated testing, building, and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or CircleCI.

#### 8. Code Quality and Security
8.1. **Static Code Analysis**
  - [8.1.1] Integrate tools like Flake8, Black, or Pylint for code quality checks.

8.2. **Dependency Management**
  - [8.2.1] Use tools like Dependabot to manage and update dependencies.

#### 9. Extended Documentation
9.1. **Contribution Guidelines**
  - [9.1.1] Write clear guidelines for contributing to the project, including code style, commit messages, and pull request process.

9.2. **Changelog**
  - [9.2.1] Maintain a changelog to document all changes, improvements, and fixes over time.
